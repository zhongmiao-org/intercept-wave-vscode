# Release Process

This document describes the automated release process for Intercept Wave VSCode extension.

## Overview

The release process is semi-automated using GitHub Actions:

1. **Manual**: Update version and changelog
2. **Automatic**: CI creates draft release with changelog
3. **Manual**: Review and publish the draft release
4. **Automatic**: Extension is published to VS Code Marketplace

## Step-by-Step Release Guide

### 1. Prepare the Release

#### Update Version Number

Edit `package.json`:

```json
{
    "version": "1.0.6"
}
```

#### Update CHANGELOG.md

Move changes from `[Unreleased]` to a new version section:

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Improved

### Fixed

## [1.0.6] - 2025-01-XX

### Added

- ‚ú® New feature description
- üéØ Another feature

### Improved

- üöÄ Performance improvements

### Fixed

- üêõ Bug fixes
```

**Important**: Keep the `[Unreleased]` section at the top with empty subsections for future changes!

#### Commit and Push

```bash
git add package.json CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.0.6"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Automated Draft Creation

Once you push to `main`, GitHub Actions will automatically:

1. ‚úÖ Run tests on multiple platforms
2. ‚úÖ Build the extension
3. ‚úÖ Extract changelog content from `[1.0.6]` section
4. ‚úÖ Create a draft release with:
    - Version: `v1.0.6` (from package.json)
    - Title: `v1.0.6`
    - Body: Content from `[1.0.6]` section in CHANGELOG.md

**Workflow**: `.github/workflows/build.yml`

### 3. Review the Draft Release

1. Go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/zhongmiao-org/intercept-wave-vscode/releases)
2. Find the draft release `v1.0.6`
3. Review the release notes (automatically extracted from CHANGELOG)
4. Edit if needed
5. ‚úÖ Click **"Publish release"**

### 4. Automated Publishing

When you publish the release, GitHub Actions will automatically:

1. ‚úÖ Compile the extension
2. ‚úÖ Publish to VS Code Marketplace
3. ‚úÖ Attach `.vsix` file to the release

**Workflow**: `.github/workflows/release.yml`

**Required Secret**: `VSCE_PAT` (VS Code Marketplace Personal Access Token)

## CHANGELOG Format

The CI workflow expects this format:

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Improved

### Fixed

## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added

- Feature 1
- Feature 2

### Improved

- Improvement 1

### Fixed

- Bug fix 1
```

**Key Points**:

- Always keep `[Unreleased]` at the top
- Use `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` format for versions
- Include date for released versions
- Subsections: `Added`, `Improved`, `Fixed` (or `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Security`)

## Version Numbering

Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **Major** (1.0.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0): Breaking changes
- **Minor** (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.1.0): New features, backwards compatible
- **Patch** (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1): Bug fixes, backwards compatible

## Troubleshooting

### Draft Release Not Created

**Issue**: No draft release after pushing to main

**Solution**:

- Check GitHub Actions tab for errors
- Ensure you pushed to `main` branch
- Verify `package.json` has updated version

### Changelog Not Extracted

**Issue**: Draft release has default notes instead of changelog

**Solution**:

- Check CHANGELOG.md format matches expected pattern
- Ensure version header uses `## [X.Y.Z]` format
- Version in CHANGELOG should match package.json

### Publication Failed

**Issue**: Release published but not on VS Code Marketplace

**Solution**:

- Check GitHub Actions logs for errors
- Verify `VSCE_PAT` secret is valid
- Ensure publisher name in package.json is correct (`Ark65`)

### Multiple Draft Releases

**Issue**: Old draft releases accumulating

**Solution**:

- Old drafts are automatically deleted before creating new ones
- You can manually delete old drafts from GitHub Releases page

## Manual Release (Emergency)

If automated release fails, you can publish manually:

```bash
# Install vsce
npm install -g @vscode/vsce

# Compile
npm run compile

# Package
vsce package

# Publish
vsce publish --pat YOUR_PAT_TOKEN
```

## Post-Release Checklist

After publishing a release:

- [ ] Verify extension appears on [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ark65.intercept-wave)
- [ ] Test installation: `code --install-extension Ark65.intercept-wave`
- [ ] Update any external documentation
- [ ] Announce release (if applicable)
- [ ] Start working on next version (add items to `[Unreleased]` section)
